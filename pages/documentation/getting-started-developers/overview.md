Getting started for developers will lead you, step-by-step, through the process of installing and compiling the Design System and customizing your project using components and design tokens. If you prefer a hands-on demonstration of this process, please check out [our interactive tutorial](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-tutorial), which will take you through the same steps using a pre-made example website.

As always, we're here for you if you have any questions. Please get in touch via GitHub, Slack, or email!


## What you need
We recommend using the following tools when working with USWDS:
- Node (use the version specified in the [.nvmrc file](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/main/.nvmrc); if needed, [download the latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from Node.js)
- npm
- Sass (we use [the latest `sass` package from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass))

These step-by-step instructions describe how to get started with USWDS using npm (recommended method).

If npm is not a viable tool for your project, however, you can [download and install the system directly](https://github.com/uswds/uswds#download-and-install) as outlined in GitHub.

We’ve designed USWDS to support older and newer browsers through [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement). The design system follows the [2% rule](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/25/support-for-browsers/): we officially support any browser above 2% usage as observed by [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/). In other words, USWDS version 2.0 supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11 and up. The next major version of USWDS (3.0) will drop support of Internet Explorer 11.

## Step-by-step
Get started with USWDS by installing the design system on your project, compiling your project's Sass from the USWDS source, and customizing the design system to fit your project needs as outlined in the following phases:

[**Phase 1: Install**]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/getting-started/developers/phase-one-install/) →

[**Phase 2: Compile**]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/getting-started/developers/phase-two-compile/) →

[**Phase 3: Customize**]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/getting-started/developers/phase-three-customize/) →
