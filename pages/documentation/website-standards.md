The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act ([P.L. 115-336](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) § 3(e)) requires “any website of an executive agency that is made available to the public after the date of enactment of this Act shall be in compliance with the website standards of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services Administration.”

Agencies should use the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) maturity model to deliver a great digital experience:

<ul>
  <li>Integrate design principles.</li>
  <li>Follow user experience guidance.</li>
  <li>Use USWDS code.</li>
</ul>

Agencies should use the maturity model to adopt USWDS incrementally, and prioritize implementation to align with the priorities identified in their modernization plans and the Act’s reports.
