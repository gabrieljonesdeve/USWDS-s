## Get started

Anyone can contribute to the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS). Whether it's submitting a bug or proposing a new component, we welcome your ideas on how to improve the Design System.

We review all contributions before merging them into USWDS. If you’re unsure about anything, just [ask](mailto:uswds@gsa.gov) — or submit your [issue]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/contribute/#report-bugs-and-issues) or [pull request]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/contribute/#submit-a-pull-request) anyway. We’ll reach out to you if we have any questions or need to start a conversation.

Before submitting a contribution, you’ll just need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) or [sign in](https://github.com/login) to your existing account.

If you want to see some other contributions before submitting your own, check out [some good first issues](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) from other community members. Again, if you’ve got questions,  [reach out to us](mailto:uswds@gsa.gov).

## Report bugs and issues

If something isn’t working the way it's supposed to, here’s how you can let us know:

1. Check our [current issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+) to see if your bug has already been reported.
1. If your bug has already been reported, leave a comment in the original issue and provide any additional context (if different than the original submission).
1. Document the steps we can take to reproduce the bug. If you can, take screen shots to capture specific details about the bug.
1. Submit an issue using the [bug report template](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug%2CStatus%3A+Triage%2CNeeds%3A+Confirmation&template=bug_report.yaml&title=USWDS+-+Bug%3A+%5BYOUR+TITLE%5D). A USWDS core team member may reach out to you if we need further clarification or context. We may also need your help testing possible solutions. Be sure to check in on your issue to answer any questions we may have about it.

If you have a code fix for the issue, go ahead and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/compare). Our team tracks issues, so make sure any pull request you submit has a related issue.

## Propose a feature request or enhancement

If you’ve got a new idea or a suggestion for how something could work better, we want to hear about it. Here are a few steps to help you submit a feature request or enhancement.

1. Check our [feature requests backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Feature+Request%22) for any duplicate or similar feature requests. If your idea has already been suggested, upvote that feature request with a thumbs up emoji and comment on the issue to let us know why you need this feature request and any other supporting information. We review the number of upvotes to help us prioritize feature requests.
<br/><br/>If you want to find other feature requests open for upvoting, check out our [feature request backlog view (sorted by those with the most upvotes)](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Voting+Open+%F0%9F%91%8D%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).

2. If your idea is not in the [current issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Feature+Request%22), submit an issue using the [feature request template](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Feature+Request%2CStatus%3A+Triage&template=feature_request.yaml&title=USWDS+-+Feature%3A+%5BYOUR+TITLE%5D).  A USWDS core team member may reach out to you if we need further clarification on your submission.

## Submit a pull request

If you want to propose a code fix, here are some steps to help you submit pull requests.

### If it's a bug fix:

1. Check our [open issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues) for any duplicate or similar issues.
1. If your bug has already been submitted, feel free to comment and provide additional context (if different than the original submission).
1. If your proposed fix is not in the open issues backlog, create an [issue](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new/choose) for the change you’re proposing.  This helps us track our work.
1. Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
1. Create a branch from `develop` that lightly defines what you’re working on (for example, add-styles).
1. Once you’re ready to submit a pull request, fill out the [pull request template](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/compare).
1. Link your pull request to the issue you created. This important step helps us know which issue this solution fixes. Tip: You can link the pull request in the body of the pull request template using the GitHub comment closes `#issue-no` or `resolves #issue-no`.
1. Submit your pull request against the `develop` branch.

If the pull request is accepted, we will schedule the issue and merge the pull request for you.

### If it's a feature request or enhancement:

1. Check our [open issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues) for any duplicate or similar issues.
1. If your idea has already been suggested, upvote that feature request with a thumbs up emoji and comment on the issue to let us know why you need this feature request or enhancement and any other supporting information.
<br/>**Tip:** If you want to find other feature requests open for upvoting, check out our [feature request view sorted by status](https://github.com/orgs/uswds/projects/8/views/18?sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=asc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status).
1. If your proposed fix is not in the [open issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues), [create an issue](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=) describing your proposal. This doesn’t mean we don’t want you to create a pull request. We simply want to start the process with an online conversation first. Plus, other community members might have supporting thoughts to add to your proposal. If you’ve already got a pull request, no worries. Go ahead and attach it to the issue.

### Want to propose something else?

If you’d like to contribute something else that doesn’t fall into any of the above, we’d still love to hear about it. Just [create an issue](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new/choose) or a [discussion](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions), and we can talk about it.

## How we prioritize

Once you’ve submitted a contribution, we'll triage it based on the following considerations:

1. **Size**: Can we accomplish this in a sprint or will this take longer?
1. **Severity**: What type of functionality is impacted? Is there a workaround?
1. **Priority**: Does this align with our vision and roadmap goals?

**Note**: We prioritize issues that affect accessibility.

These considerations help us decide if and when we can work on the issue. If the issue is accepted, we scheduled them for an upcoming sprint (a 2-week work period).

You can stay up to date on the status of your contributions through [GitHub email notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) (external link) and the assigned labels on the issue.
