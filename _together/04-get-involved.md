As people working in the federal space we all need to advocate for inclusive experiences[^1]. We’re all learning together, but some specific actions you can take today are:

<div class="measure-4" markdown="1">
* Include team members with diverse experiences and perspectives.
* Emphasize impact over intent.
* Uncover inequities and disparities through disaggregation.
* Lead with community voices and needs — emphasize people over process[^2].
* Practice transparency and integrity in your actions.
* Challenge your own assumptions and biases. Recognize that there is no universal baseline for experiences.
* Own your responsibility to ensure that the research we conduct is as inclusive and representative as possible.
* Engage with non-profits and community groups to identify, recruit, and fairly compensate diverse users.
* Consider who benefits and who may be harmed with each design.
* Ask yourself who is invited and who is absent from the discussion. 
* Identify who is best positioned to help us understand how to make our solutions better.

The patterns are a start, but we need your help keeping these patterns current as design practices and DEIA norms evolve. We encourage you to continue to share your knowledge and expertise.
