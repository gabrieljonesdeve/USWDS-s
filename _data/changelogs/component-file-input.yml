  - date: 2021-11-01
    summary: Fixed a duplicate file bug in file input.
    summaryAdditional: If a file with the same name was uploaded in two separate file input fields, the preview spinner would spin indefinitely. We now assign each upload an individual ID, and the image preview loads properly.

  - date: 2021-11-01
    summary: Added automatic sanitizing.
    summaryAdditional: The design system now automatically sanitizes content in elements we compose with JavaScript. This means that components like combo box, tooltip, file input, and date picker will sanitize any content passed to them. This helps protect any design system implementation against malicious XSS attacks through these components.
