- **Qualitative comparison A/B test of external link indicator:** In May–June 2021, USWDS conducted research around using an external link indicator for text links to external websites. We first performed a landscape analysis of commonly used external link icons and designed an alternative variant of the external link indicator. Then, we conducted a qualitative comparison A/B usability test of our default external link icon and a newly designed “Exit” badge. Our findings:
  - Users understand a link's destination when that destination is included in the link text or the context of the link.
  - Users are more likely to ignore link icons and badges than think about their meaning.
  - Users didn't consistently understand either the external link icon nor an “Exit” badge.
  - Users expect an icon or badge alongside a link to be clickable.
  - If users have a specific goal to accomplish on a page, they won’t leave that page and follow a link elsewhere until they complete their task on the current page.
  - Links can be a distraction when users read blocks of text.
  - Long link text can be hard to read or understand.
  - Government-speak and acronyms make links more confusing.
  - Paragraphs with lots of links can be hard to read or understand.
  - Users expect to find reference links at the bottom of the page.
  - Users find agency name/branding in the top left corner of a web page critical for orientation.
