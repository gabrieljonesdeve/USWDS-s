{:.site-note}
**Note:** Banners and [identifiers]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/identifier) are core components. We recommend using both core components on most sites. Together, they are the most recognizable and standardized design elements of a government site.

You should use the banner to identify your site as an official government site.

The banner explains how to identify an official .gov or .mil domain and that these sites have secure HTTPS connections. Using the banner component is the best way to assure visitors that they're connected to an official site.

Most government sites should use the banner, but some should not use the banner. Do NOT use the banner on non-government domains such as a .com or .org.

If you are unable to update to [USWDS 2.8.0](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/releases) (described on GitHub) or higher but still want to include the new language in your banner, we recommend editing your content to the language outlined in the component preview.
