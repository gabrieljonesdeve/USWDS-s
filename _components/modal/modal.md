A modal prevents interaction with page content until the user completes an action or dismisses the modal. This intentionally interrupts the userâ€™s workflow. **Use modals sparingly to minimize unnecessary disruptions.**

Modals should have a simple headline that explains its purpose. Use enough descriptive text to be clear what the user needs to do and why. Avoid using modals to display complex forms or large amounts of information.
