      element: .usa-time-picker
      description: The time picker will use this regular expression to filter the time picker options. You are declaring a case insensitive match over the entire option text, which means `^` and `$` are added automatically. You can specify the inputted query with `{{query}}`. You can also declare a custom query filter as a data property as well, which can be used in the custom filter (`data-number-filter="[0-9]"` and then using `data-filter="{{numberFilter}}.*"`). The default filter is `.*{{query}}.*`, which is a simple "find anywhere within the option" text.
