  <ul class="usa-content-list">
    <li><strong>Don’t control element order with CSS.</strong> Display form controls in the same order in the HTML as
      they appear on screen. Don’t use CSS to rearrange the form controls. Screen readers narrate form elements in the
      order they appear in the HTML.</li>
    <li><strong>Align validation with inputs.</strong> Visually align validation messages with the input fields so
      people using screen magnifiers can read them quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Use proper markup.</strong> Group each set of thematically related controls in a fieldset element. Use
      the legend element to offer a label within each one. The fieldset and legend elements make it easier for those who
      use screen readers to navigate the form.</li>
    <li><strong>Use legends.</strong> Use a single legend for fieldset (this is required). One common use of the
      fieldset and legend elements is a question with radio-button options for answers. The question text and radio
      buttons are wrapped in a fieldset, with the question itself being inside the legend tag.</li>
    <li><strong>Embed multiple fieldsets and legends for more complex forms.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Use simple vertical layouts.</strong> Keep your form blocks in a vertical pattern. This approach is
      ideal, from an accessibility standpoint, because of limited vision that makes it hard to scan from right to left.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Keep form elements enabled and offer feedback.</strong> Don’t use disabled or unavailable states. 
      These states often don’t interact well with assistive technology, and they can confuse users. Instead, keep 
      elements enabled and use contextual helper text, tooltips, 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion.html">helpful error messages</a>, 
      and inline validation. These approaches can show what caused a problem and guide people to a solution.

  <h2 id="identifying-required-fields">Identifying required fields</h2>
  <ul class="usa-content-list">
    <li><strong>Show whether a field is required or optional.</strong> Mark required fields as required by using a red
      asterisk (<abbr title="required" class="usa-hint--required">*</abbr>).</li>
    <li><strong>Use text descriptions.</strong> Combine red asterisks (<abbr title="required"
        class="usa-hint--required">*</abbr>) with a text description at the top of the form instructing the user of its
      meaning. <br />
      <em>Example:</em> “A red asterisk (<abbr title="required" class="usa-hint--required">*</abbr>) indicates a
      required field.”
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use the <code>required</code> attribute.</strong> Add the <code>required</code> attribute to your form
      elements to indicate that a field must be filled out before submitting the form.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark optional fields as "optional."</strong> Label optional fields with the word “optional” placed in
      parentheses. <br />
      <em>Example:</em> (optional)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Let users know if there is an error.</strong> Use a message or <a
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}/components/alert">alert</a> to notify the user if a field that is required was not
      completed, and indicate which field was not completed. Additionally, include an error notification in the page
      title (<code>title</code> element) for screen readers.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Note:</strong> One-field forms are the exception and do not need to be marked with a required label or symbol.</em>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="known-issues-with-screen-readers">Known issues with screen readers</h2>
  <ul class="usa-content-list">
    <li>VoiceOver on iOS currently does not support fieldset and legend elements for forms. You can address this issue
      by using <code>aria-labelledby="for-attribute-of-label id-of-legend id-of-additional-info"</code> on each input in
      the fieldset. Using <code>aria-labelledby</code> will overwrite the default text read by the screen reader, so it
      is important to include all relevant information.</li>
    <li>
      VoiceOver on OS X offers partial support for <code>aria-describedby</code>. There's full support for conveying
      description on text inputs, partial support for description changes when the text input is in focus, and no
      support for <code>role="alert"</code>. Visit <a
        href="https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-describedby_attribute">a11ysupport.io</a> to view the full status of
      support.</li>
